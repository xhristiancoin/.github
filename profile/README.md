# Welcome to the $XHRISTIAN Protocol Organization

This organization is the canonical source for the complete and version-controlled specification of the $XHRISTIAN ecosystem. It serves as the immutable ledger for the protocol's foundational logic.

## ⚙️ Purpose & Architecture

This repository structure contains the formal documentation layer for $XHRISTIAN. Its core function is to establish and preserve the protocol's **axiomatic principles**—the lore, narrative, and commandments that form its unchangeable constitution. This "root specification" defines the invariant state and first principles from which all community standards, technical parameters, and on-chain proofs are logically derived.

The architecture is engineered as a verifiable stack. The immutable logic acts as the root node, governing all downstream specifications. This creates a deterministic audit path from narrative to technical implementation to cryptographic on-chain state.

## 🔍 For Engineers & Contributors

This organization is maintained for verification and controlled evolution. All contributions must demonstrate logical consistency with the established root specifications, ensuring the protocol's axiomatic integrity is preserved across all layers of documentation.
