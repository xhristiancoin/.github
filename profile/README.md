# 🛡️ Welcome to the $XHRISTIAN Protocol Organization

This organization maintains the canonical, version-controlled documentation for the $XHRISTIAN ecosystem. It hosts the definitive record of the project's foundational axioms, narrative, and governing commandments, serving as the authoritative rule set for all community standards and interactions. The specification defines the protocol's core intent and establishes the principles for its sustained evolution.

## ⚙️ Foundation

This documentation acts as the foundational node, explicitly defining the parameters for community engagement and contribution. It creates a deterministic pathway from declared principle to documented practice, ensuring all activity aligns with the protocol's formalized social contract. The documentation is written for rigor and longevity, emphasizing transparent, rule-based participation built on human principles over predictions.

## 🛠️ For Contributors and Community Managers

This organization is for those prepared to define, audit, and evolve the logical frameworks that govern decentralized participation. Contributions here directly shape the structural integrity and future trajectory of the $XHRISTIAN protocol, establishing a coordination layer for the community defined by its principles.

*The runtime execution and state of the protocol are verifiable on the Solana blockchain, and is discussed within associated public community channels.*
