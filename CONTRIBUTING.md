# Contributing to XHRISTIAN

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the XHRISTIAN project. We believe that clear, thoughtful documentation is the foundation of a strong community. All contributions that help clarify our principles, improve our resources, or expand our narrative are welcome.

This document provides a guide for making contributions.

## Our Philosophy

The XHRISTIAN project is built on the principle of **"verify, then trust."** We extend this to our documentation:
1.  **Verify** the existing content and context.
2.  **Propose** changes that align with the project's established principles.
3.  **Collaborate** transparently with the community.

## How to Contribute

We manage contributions through GitHub's standard collaborative workflow.

### 1. Reporting Issues or Suggestions
If you find an error, have a question, or wish to suggest an improvement:
*   Use the **Issues** tab on the relevant repository.
*   Clearly describe the context and the proposed change or fix.
*   Be respectful and constructive.

### 2. Proposing Changes via Pull Request (PR)
This is the best way to contribute text, fixes, or new documents.

**Step-by-Step:**
1.  **Fork** the repository you want to contribute to.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3.  Create a new **branch** for your changes (e.g., `fix-typo-commandments`).
4.  Make your changes. Please ensure your writing is clear and professional.
5.  **Commit** your changes with a descriptive message.
6.  **Push** your branch to your fork on GitHub.
7.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your fork to the main repository.

### What to Contribute To
*   **`community` Wiki:** This is the most open space for contributions. You can suggest edits or new pages for lore, guides, and FAQs directly via its interface.
*   **`protocol` Repository:** Proposals to the core specification (e.g., phrasing in the Manifesto) require careful discussion and strong alignment with existing principles.
*   **General Feedback:** Community discussion about the direction of the project is encouraged in our associated public channels.

## Review Process
A project steward will review your Pull Request. We aim to review all contributions promptly. Feedback or requests for clarification are part of a healthy collaboration.

Thank you for helping build a transparent and principled foundation for the XHRISTIAN community.
